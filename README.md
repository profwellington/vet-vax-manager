Keywords: Vaccination System, Database design, MVC.

This work presents the development of a vaccination management system, similar to Conecte SUS, but for domestic and rural animals.
The structuring of the necessary relational database up to writing the source code that implements the system interactions. 
The initial objective was to develop a veterinary clinic management system with functionalities covering all common processes in a clinic.
However, due to time limitations, the scope was reduced to focus exclusively on vaccination management, specifically catering to animal owners.
In the first stage, examples of similar medical clinic management systems, used as a basis for the veterinary system, are presented. 
This stage also discusses the MVC design pattern adopted for development, the use cases created, and the functional and non-functional requirements derived from these use cases. 
In the second stage, the elements responsible for building the system are detailed, including the entity-relationship diagram, the mapping of the relational model derived from this diagram, the definition of database tables, the system's source code components, and the final screens after implementation.
